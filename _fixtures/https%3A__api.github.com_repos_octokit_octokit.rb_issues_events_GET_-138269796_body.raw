Here's the diff: https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb/compare/master...jeromegn:branch-slash\n\nMy understanding is that pretty much everywhere a SHA is accepted, a branch name also is. In the case where the branch has a slash in it, a 404 is returned (correctly):\n\n``` ruby\nirb(main):002:0> Octokit.tree('bem/bem-tools', 'support/0.9.x')\nOctokit::NotFound: GET https://api.github.com/repos/bem/bem-tools/git/trees/support/0.9.x?client_id=bbb6aa3e2e9db58ce884&client_secret=(redacted): 404 - Not Found // See: https://developer.github.com/v3\n```\n\nHowever, if I try to `CGI::escape` the name and provide it to `Octokit#tree`, it double escapes it (could be the HTTP client) and will send the request with the branch as \"support%252F0.9.x\". Example:\n\n``` ruby\nirb(main):001:0> Octokit.tree('bem/bem-tools', CGI::escape('support/0.9.x'))\nOctokit::NotFound: GET https://api.github.com/repos/bem/bem-tools/git/trees/support%252F0.9.x?client_id=bbb6aa3e2e9db58ce884&client_secret=(redacted): 404 - Not Found // See: https://developer.github.com/v3\n```\n\nI've been able to successfully request it from the API from a raw request (not using Octokit) by encoding the slash manually like so: (here, I'm using HTTPie)\n\n``` bash\n$ http GET https://api.github.com/repos/bem/bem-tools/git/trees/support%2F0.9.x                                                     \nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nAccess-Control-Expose-Headers: ETag, Link, X-GitHub-OTP, X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset, X-OAuth-Scopes, X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes, X-Poll-Interval\nCache-Control: public, max-age=60, s-maxage=60\nContent-Encoding: gzip\nContent-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 16 Jun 2015 01:38:02 GMT\nETag: W/\"1f0e637713aca005d74723e698d922ed\"\nLast-Modified: Fri, 01 May 2015 01:01:04 GMT\nServer: GitHub.com\nStatus: 200 OK\nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains; preload\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nVary: Accept\nVary: Accept-Encoding\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nX-Frame-Options: deny\nX-GitHub-Media-Type: github.v3\nX-GitHub-Request-Id: 6BB3FFE6:5FD5:83BC1DF:557F7DFA\nX-RateLimit-Limit: 60\nX-RateLimit-Remaining: 50\nX-RateLimit-Reset: 1434420429\nX-Served-By: 5aeb3f30c9e3ef6ef7bcbcddfd9a68f7\nX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\n\n{\n    \"sha\": \"9cac8a1b14c28d6101696e99858b238b4859792d\",\n    \"tree\": [\n        {\n# ...\n```\n\nAny idea how we can fix this?
