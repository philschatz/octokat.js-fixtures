There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.\n\nI recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of octokat.\nGiven that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.\n\n\n---\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<p>The new version differs by 39 commits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a
