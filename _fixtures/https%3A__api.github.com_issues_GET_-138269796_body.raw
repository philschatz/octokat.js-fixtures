Summary\r\n\r\nWe've run into a issue with the version.txt within webview. The problem arose because the intuitive thing to do from the DevOps perspective didn't match up with what actually happens. So we need to fix that.\r\nIt was believed that the webview tarball didn't need to be recreated since the tag from `v0.22.1rc4` is equal to `v0.22.1`. Thus, why rebuild it? Well, the problem is that the tarballs may be build from the same changeset but they come out with one significant difference, the contents of `version.txt`.\r\n\r\nYou can see an example of this:\r\n```\r\n$ http -b http://cnx.org/version.txt\r\nv0.22.1rc4-dev74f5709\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe are going to fix this minor difference by simply removing it. We will now be rendering the `version.txt` file during deployment instead of at build/compilation time.\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] remove `version.txt` from the tarball build script (@philschatz)\r\n- [ ] remove the `latest` and `latest-stable` symlinks from {builds,packages}.cnx.org (@DarkPrinceFrost | @dtwilliamson | @pumazi)\r\n- [x] put a sha bit in the webview code, if possible; otherwise put it in a `rev.txt` (@philschatz)\r\n- [x] remove the `latest` and `latest-stable` symlink creation from the build script (@philschatz)\r\n- [x] remove tasks that use `latest*` in cnx-deploy (@pumazi | @DarkPrinceFrost | @dtwilliamson)\r\n- [x] create tasks to render the `version.txt` in cnx-deploy (@pumazi | @DarkPrinceFrost | @dtwilliamson)\r\n\r\n##
