(https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb/blob/568745f/lib/octokit/client/labels.rb#L88). CGI.escape is escaping the space as a + rather than %20, which the API doesn't appear to accept.\n\nThe request method escapes too (https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb/blob/568745f/lib/octokit/client.rb#L339), but this isn't complete - it won't escape special URL characters such as \"?\" in label names, so removing CGI.escape would break those labels instead.  Unfortunately changing CGI.escape to another method (ERB::Util.url_encode?) that escapes spaces as %20 will only cause the % to be escaped again in the request method.\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octokit/octokit.rb/issues/comments/304877713","html_url":"https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb/issues/560#issuecomment-304877713","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octokit/octokit.rb/issues/560","id":304877713,"user":{"login":"pengwynn","id":865,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/865?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengwynn","html_url":"https://github.com/pengwynn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengwynn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengwynn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengwynn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengwynn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengwynn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengwynn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengwynn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengwynn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengwynn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-30T13:27:44Z","updated_at":"2017-05-30T13:27:44Z","body":"@kareem we may have had a regression since bumping Addressable in the past two years.

(https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb/blob/568745f/lib/octokit/client/labels.rb#L88). CGI.escape is escaping the space as a + rather than %20, which the API doesn't appear to accept.\n\nThe request method escapes too (https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb/blob/568745f/lib/octokit/client.rb#L339), but this isn't complete - it won't escape special URL characters such as \"?\" in label names, so removing CGI.escape would break those labels instead.  Unfortunately changing CGI.escape to another method (ERB::Util.url_encode?) that escapes spaces as %20 will only cause the % to be escaped again in the request method.\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octokit/octokit.rb/issues/comments/304686244","html_url":"https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb/issues/560#issuecomment-304686244","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/octokit/octokit.rb/issues/560","id":304686244,"user":{"login":"kareem","id":26123,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/26123?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kareem","html_url":"https://github.com/kareem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kareem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kareem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kareem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kareem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kareem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kareem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kareem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kareem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kareem/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-29T15:24:08Z","updated_at":"2017-05-29T15:24:08Z","body":"@pengwynn I'm getting a 404 when deleting a label with a forward slash in it e.g. (\"foo/bar\").
