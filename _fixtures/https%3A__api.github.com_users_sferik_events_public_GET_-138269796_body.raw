having some dependency conflicts updating the gems in my app, I mainly want this because the twitter gem bumped its faraday dependency.\r\nhttps://github.com/sferik/twitter/commit/6eb494d7c4ac1b06730d22bc9183e6a9035e3643\r\n\r\nI don't see anything potentially breaking in 0.11.0 except the new `block syntax to customise the adapter`:\r\nhttps://github.com/lostisland/faraday/releases/tag/v0.11.0\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if its possible to test against faraday 0.11.0 on CI, but I tried running the tests locally with faraday 0.11.0 and I didn't see any breakage.","created_at":"2017-01-17T02:30:47Z","updated_at":"2017-03-03T09:50:50Z","closed_at":"2017-03-03T09:50:50Z","merged_at":"2017-03-03T09:50:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"a7d21910c5803ea542dd6270a6dc6cfab1930f8b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intridea/oauth2/pulls/287/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intridea/oauth2/pulls/287/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intridea/oauth2/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intridea/oauth2/issues/287/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/intridea/oauth2/statuses/2aaa2b28b57c53540dc16b969587fe9df4d1035e","head":{"label":"mcfiredrill:bump-faraday-version","ref":"bump-faraday-version","sha":"2aaa2b28b57c53540dc16b969587fe9df4d1035e","user":{"login":"mcfiredrill","id":66243,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/66243?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcfiredrill","html_url":"https://github.com/mcfiredrill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcfiredrill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcfiredrill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcfiredrill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcfiredrill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcfiredrill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcfiredrill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcfiredrill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcfiredrill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcfiredrill/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":79178143,"name":"oauth2","full_name":"mcfiredrill/oauth2","owner":{"login":"mcfiredrill","id":66243,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/66243?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcfiredrill","html_url":"https://github.com/mcfiredrill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcfiredrill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcfiredrill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcfiredrill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcfiredrill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcfiredrill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcfiredrill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcfiredrill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcfiredrill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcfiredrill/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/mcfiredrill/oauth2","description":"A
