have a script that we want to run only after all other scripts have failed to match.

The problem with the catchAll approach is that middleware listeners run for everything, and in some cases the content of the middleware listeners context/response is empty (for instance text is empty).\n\nA better approach would seem to be to use a matching function (as opposed to a regex or catchAll) to determine whether or not to match.
