\r\n\r\nI have created two join tables. One I created manually as a normal table and model - that works fine in Rails Admin. The second I created with the command \r\n\r\n`rails g migration CreateJoinTableUserSupplier user supplier\r\n`\r\n(I then added a few other fields) \r\n\r\nThis is what the db/schema.rb says about that table.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  create_table \"suppliers_users\", id: false, force: :cascade do |t|\r\n    t.integer \"user_id\"\r\n    t.integer \"supplier_id\"\r\n    t.integer \"relationship\"\r\n    t.string  \"reason\"\r\n    t.boolean \"public\"\r\n    t.index [\"supplier_id\", \"user_id\"], name: \"index_suppliers_users_on_supplier_id_and_user_id\"\r\n    t.index [\"user_id\", \"supplier_id\"], name: \"index_suppliers_users_on_user_id_and_supplier_id\"\r\n  end\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy problem is that when rails_admin attempts to display that table for editing it gets confused and gives this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nActiveRecord::StatementInvalid at /user_supplier\r\nSQLite3::SQLException: no such column: suppliers_users.desc: SELECT  \"suppliers_users\".* FROM \"suppliers_users\" ORDER BY suppliers_users. desc LIMIT ? OFFSET ?\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the \"suppliers_users.desc\" is I think wrong. The SQL which appears on the console is \r\n\r\n`  UserSupplier Load (2.5ms)  SELECT  \"suppliers_users\".* FROM \"suppliers_users\" ORDER BY suppliers_users. desc LIMIT ? OFFSET ?  [[\"LIMIT\", 20], [\"OFFSET\", 0]]`\r\n\r\nNote there is a space before \"desc\". This suggests to me that it is trying to order by a column - but does not know which. I believe that \"suppliers_users. desc\" should be \"suppliers_users.SOMECOLUMNNAME desc\"\r\n\r\nIs this a feature I need to add as config? Is it a bug? Is something wrong with my table? (I can add records to it through my model....\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I do have a working join table which was not created through the rails generate join table command. \r\n\r\n```\r\n  create_table \"user_services\", force: :cascade do |t|\r\n    t.datetime \"created_at\", null: false\r\n    t.datetime \"updated_at\", null: false\r\n    t.integer  \"service_id\"\r\n    t.integer  \"user_id\"\r\n  end\r\n```\r\n\r\nI note that there is no \"id: false, \" flag. Is that the problem?\r\n\r\nLooking at the raw tables I see that the join table does NOT have an id column.\r\n\r\n```\r\nrails db\r\n.schema\r\n\r\n/* Works! */\r\nCREATE TABLE \"user_services\" (\"id\" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL, \"created_at\" datetime NOT NULL, \"updated_at\" datetime NOT NULL, \"service_id\" integer, \"user_id\" integer);\r\n/* Does Not Work! */\r\nCREATE TABLE \"suppliers_users\" (\"user_id\" integer, \"supplier_id\" integer, \"relationship\" integer, \"reason\" varchar, \"public\" boolean);\r\n\r\n```\r\nSo is there something special about Rails join tables that are different from a normal table with two references, and should I be using them with Rails_admin?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: I am using rails5"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sferik/rails_admin/issues/comments/301033201","html_url":"https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin/issues/2784#issuecomment-301033201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sferik/rails_admin/issues/2784","id":301033201,"user":{"login":"nicwillemse","id":804814,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/804814?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicwillemse","html_url":"https://github.com/nicwillemse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicwillemse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicwillemse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicwillemse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicwillemse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicwillemse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicwillemse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicwillemse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicwillemse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicwillemse/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-12T09:44:13Z","updated_at":"2017-05-12T09:44:13Z","body":"@alexmc6 did you manage to circumvent this ?

4.1 introduced enum attributes](http://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Enum.html) which don't behave well with RailsAdmin. \n\nRailsAdmin (v 0.6.2) threats enum attributes as integers by default. This can be \"fixed\" by adding method to the model, ie.\n\n```\nenum status: [ :active, :archived ]\ndef status_enum\n  self.class.statuses.to_a\nend\n```\n\nThere is another issue - creating or updating record raises:\n\n```\nArgumentError in RailsAdmin::MainController#new \n'1' is not a valid state\n```\n\nObviously the controller got `'1'` as a string value which doesn't match any of the states (`'active'`, `'archived'`), nor state as integer (`0`, `1`).\nThe quick fix might look like:\n\n```\ndef status= value\n  if value.kind_of?(String) and value.to_i.to_s == value\n    super value.to_i\n  else\n    super value\n  end\nend\n```\n\nIt works, but isn't nice. Especially when you have multiple enum attributes.\n\nLooking forward to support for `ActiveRecord::Enum` out of the box.\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sferik/rails_admin/issues/comments/300809001","html_url":"https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin/issues/1993#issuecomment-300809001","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sferik/rails_admin/issues/1993","id":300809001,"user":{"login":"onlyyouandty","id":7871367,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7871367?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onlyyouandty","html_url":"https://github.com/onlyyouandty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onlyyouandty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onlyyouandty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onlyyouandty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onlyyouandty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onlyyouandty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onlyyouandty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onlyyouandty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onlyyouandty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onlyyouandty/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-11T14:36:06Z","updated_at":"2017-05-11T14:36:06Z","body":"@dotdidi Enum can only be integer values.

4.1 introduced enum attributes](http://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Enum.html) which don't behave well with RailsAdmin. \n\nRailsAdmin (v 0.6.2) threats enum attributes as integers by default. This can be \"fixed\" by adding method to the model, ie.\n\n```\nenum status: [ :active, :archived ]\ndef status_enum\n  self.class.statuses.to_a\nend\n```\n\nThere is another issue - creating or updating record raises:\n\n```\nArgumentError in RailsAdmin::MainController#new \n'1' is not a valid state\n```\n\nObviously the controller got `'1'` as a string value which doesn't match any of the states (`'active'`, `'archived'`), nor state as integer (`0`, `1`).\nThe quick fix might look like:\n\n```\ndef status= value\n  if value.kind_of?(String) and value.to_i.to_s == value\n    super value.to_i\n  else\n    super value\n  end\nend\n```\n\nIt works, but isn't nice. Especially when you have multiple enum attributes.\n\nLooking forward to support for `ActiveRecord::Enum` out of the box.\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sferik/rails_admin/issues/comments/300680679","html_url":"https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin/issues/1993#issuecomment-300680679","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sferik/rails_admin/issues/1993","id":300680679,"user":{"login":"dotdidi","id":24665663,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/24665663?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotdidi","html_url":"https://github.com/dotdidi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotdidi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotdidi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotdidi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotdidi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotdidi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotdidi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotdidi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotdidi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotdidi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-11T04:42:17Z","updated_at":"2017-05-11T04:42:17Z","body":"@onlyyouandty I also did experience the error in 1.1.1 but solve it by changing the data type of the enum from integer to string.
