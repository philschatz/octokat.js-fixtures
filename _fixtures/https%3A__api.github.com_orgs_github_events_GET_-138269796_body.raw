is not only Python's conventions for code formatting, it is also a dead simple toy assembly language, the repo of the language/environment itself is available on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/pep8-1/).\n\nThere's not a lot of use for it, being a toy language, it is never used in production environments.\n\nHowever, we do use it for teaching purposes in a course at the university I'm attending, being a simplified assembly-level language, it is easier for students to approach machine-level concerns without getting too overwhelmed by the complexity of real-world assembly languages such as x86 or ARM.\n\nI'm using Github as a platform for [teaching material](https://github.com/R4PaSs/PEP8-examples), since there will be some PEP-8 code hosted here, I figured this would be a good time to try and have the language recognized and highlighted by Github.\n\nSome students also use Github as a mean to versionize their code, I have a few examples of assignments done by students during previous sessions of the course:\n- [4-in-a-row](https://github.com/Freddrickk/Puissance4)\n- [Brainfuck interpreter](https://github.com/madeinqc/Pep8-assembly---Brainfuck-interpreter)\n- [CamelCase to snake_case converter](https://github.com/madeinqc/Pep8-assembly---Snake-case-converter)\n\nThere might be other examples of PEP-8 code on Github, but not that I personally know of.\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/github/linguist/issues/comments/301321732","html_url":"https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/2070#issuecomment-301321732","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/github/linguist/issues/2070","id":301321732,"user":{"login":"Alhadis","id":2346707,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2346707?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alhadis","html_url":"https://github.com/Alhadis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alhadis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alhadis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alhadis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alhadis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alhadis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alhadis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alhadis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alhadis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alhadis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-14T15:55:26Z","updated_at":"2017-05-14T15:55:26Z","body":"@lildude

When hubot receives the webhook it throws the error in the issue above. I do not have access to change the app sending the post requests but I can change hubot however I need to. Therefore it would make sense to have a way to insert express middleware before hubot binds it's own middleware (this would have to be done in an init script I would assume), or possibly a way to insert middleware at the beginning of the stack when my script loads. Then I would at least be able to do something like this:\n\n``` coffeescript\nrobot.router.insertMiddleware (app) ->\n  app.use (req, res, next) ->\n    delete req.headers['content-encoding']\n    next()\n})\nrobot.router.post '/receiving/wrong/headers', (req, res) ->\n  ...\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/github/hubot/blob/5ec8f375f3ac97e9df6e45c6b459d42025b74694/src/robot.coffee#L284\n\nTo be clear the HTTP header hubot is receiving is invalid. There is no **Content-Encoding: UTF-8** header allowed. [HTTP Content-Encoding](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.11) Therefore it would make sense that express/body-parser throws that warning. If you know of a way around this or an improvement on the design above your opinion would be greatly appreciated.\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/github/hubot/issues/comments/301319636","html_url":"https://github.com/github/hubot/issues/939#issuecomment-301319636","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/github/hubot/issues/939","id":301319636,"user":{"login":"mose","id":131461,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/131461?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mose","html_url":"https://github.com/mose","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mose/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mose/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mose/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mose/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mose/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mose/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mose/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mose/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mose/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-14T15:17:29Z","updated_at":"2017-05-14T15:17:29Z","body":"I managed to add an express middleware after load time in a plugin.

is not only Python's conventions for code formatting, it is also a dead simple toy assembly language, the repo of the language/environment itself is available on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/pep8-1/).\n\nThere's not a lot of use for it, being a toy language, it is never used in production environments.\n\nHowever, we do use it for teaching purposes in a course at the university I'm attending, being a simplified assembly-level language, it is easier for students to approach machine-level concerns without getting too overwhelmed by the complexity of real-world assembly languages such as x86 or ARM.\n\nI'm using Github as a platform for [teaching material](https://github.com/R4PaSs/PEP8-examples), since there will be some PEP-8 code hosted here, I figured this would be a good time to try and have the language recognized and highlighted by Github.\n\nSome students also use Github as a mean to versionize their code, I have a few examples of assignments done by students during previous sessions of the course:\n- [4-in-a-row](https://github.com/Freddrickk/Puissance4)\n- [Brainfuck interpreter](https://github.com/madeinqc/Pep8-assembly---Brainfuck-interpreter)\n- [CamelCase to snake_case converter](https://github.com/madeinqc/Pep8-assembly---Snake-case-converter)\n\nThere might be other examples of PEP-8 code on Github, but not that I personally know of.\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/github/linguist/issues/comments/301316891","html_url":"https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/2070#issuecomment-301316891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/github/linguist/issues/2070","id":301316891,"user":{"login":"R4PaSs","id":1444825,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1444825?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/R4PaSs","html_url":"https://github.com/R4PaSs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/R4PaSs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/R4PaSs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/R4PaSs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/R4PaSs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/R4PaSs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/R4PaSs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/R4PaSs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/R4PaSs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/R4PaSs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-14T14:30:38Z","updated_at":"2017-05-14T14:30:38Z","body":"@lildude
