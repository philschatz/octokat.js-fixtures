But in reality you are just checking a random subset of random (hem..), you can't assert that with the color. \r\n\r\nA green build can then mean 2 things: \r\n\r\n* build is green\r\n* build is greenish, order dependent\r\n\r\nWhich doesn't help with (1)\r\n\r\n  (3) When comparing builds on Travis or with git dissect, (2) will bite you while debugging at 12pm and make you cry your Mum that you really don't give a shit about (1)\r\n\r\nI guess."}
